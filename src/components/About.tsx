          I am currently a 2nd-quarter student at the GIAIC, actively pursuing my BS in Computer Science at Iqra University also, where I am in my 6th semester. I previously completed my intermediate education in the Pre-Engineering field from Jinnah Government College. Before that, I completed my matriculation from F.M Public School, building a solid foundation in the sciences.
